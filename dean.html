    <h1>Dean's Message </h1>
     <p>"...My vision of Robert College centers on connection. Not just to technology, which is sometimes<br>  overly prevalent in the modern world, 
         but to ourselves, to other people, and to the natural world. These are the relationships wherein true <br> and true success in life can be found. 
         These are the connections I see daily, between our students and their amazing teachers and support<br>  staff, with the natural world, and with themselves 
         through the many reflective experiences our teaching provides. I think it is why I see <br> so much laughter at RC, despite the challenges of a demanding academic workload..."<br> 
         <br> 
         With warmest regards,<br> 
         Adam Oliver<br> 
         Head of School
